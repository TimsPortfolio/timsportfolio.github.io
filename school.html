        <p>Hello again. Here is a collection of things that are part of school. Below you can find different stories I wrote for english class, my favorite tools for school, and more.</p>
        <h1>Math Tools</h1>
        <h2>Favorite Calculator: <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator" Target="_blank">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a></h2>
        <ul><strong>Pros</strong>
            <li>Contains Many Functions.</li>
            <li>Autmoatically Graphs Equations.</li>
            <li>Variables can be set to change numbers (slowly increase/decrease) allowing your graphs to move.</li>
            <li>There are folders to organize all your functions. This is useful if you are making a drawing with math and while doing math to sort your equations by question number.</li>
            <li>You can create an account to save all your graphs.</li>
            <li>There are mobile apps so you can graph and calculate on the go.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Cons</strong>
            <li>Saved graphs just appear in one long list, so for me it can be a little cluttered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall this is my favorite calculator for school and fun stuff like <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/me6m2mqmy8" target="_blank">this</a>. I would highly recommend this calculator to everyone.</p>
        <h1>Literature</h1>
        <p>Just so you know writing is not my best subject. The date is when I submited the story to my teacher.</p>
        <h2>The School Robbery - 3/13/2020</h2>
        <p class="story">
            It was the last day of Summer. Richard and I were sad that school would start tomorrow, even though that summer was somewhat boring. Then Richard came up with a brilliant plan.
        </p><p class="story">
            “We should go to the school at night and steal school supplies.” Richard Said. “That way, school wouldn’t be able to start.”
        </p><p class="story">
            I agreed with him. In the evening, we prepared to leave. I whittled a stick to create a thin rod for picking locks. Richard tied the opening in a shirt to make a bag. After we ate dinner, we headed out toward the school. Unfortunately, some of our neighbors were currently doing their nightly vigil, some of which had a clear view of the school. After figuring out that we would definitely get caught going, we went back inside our homes. I went to bed. Around an hour later, I heard whispering.
            “Come on. There’s no one awake right now. Let’s go”
        </p><p class="story">
            I got up and went outside. We walked on eggs as we approached the school. At the door of the school, we looked around, then attempted to pick the lock. As fitted with the lock, I accidentally cleaved the stick, rendering it useless. We walked around the school and found an open window. We climbed inside, and found many gnats swarming around inside. I opened the windows to let them fly out. Richard yielded several chalkboards and chalk from draws. I wanted to get the globe from the top shelf. I climbed on top of a desk and reached up. I wasn’t tall enough. I placed some books on the desk to reach higher. As I tip-toed, the desk tipped over and I fell towards a window, shattering it. My breeches and shirt protected me from most of the glass, but my lower leg had a bunch of cuts in it. Then Richard spotted lights outside. Neighbors were waking up to see what had happened. We ran out to the nearest tree. I washed my wounds while Richard watched for Neighbors. After waiting around half an hour, we were baffled. Why didn’t anyone show up? We decided to head back to the school. We bagged up as many items as we could get then head back as fast as possible. Carrying all of the items out was burdensome, but we felt it was worth it. But then we faced a problem. Where are we going to hide these items? We figured we wouldn’t need them for anything, so we threw everything in the pond. We both ran back to our homes and went to bed.
        </p><p class="story">
            The next day, I went to school. Richard and I were waiting to be told that school was canceled, but school went on like normal. But because we hid all of the school supplies, school was less engaging. It was just a lot of talking the whole day.

        <h2>Climb Through the Storm - 2/26/2020</h2>
        <p class="story">
            Henry and David were neighbors on summer vacation. They were both very adventurous, and both decided to go rock climbing during the summer. They drove to the base of a mountain, grabbed their gear and started climbing.
        </p><p class="story">
            “The weather is really nice today.” Henry said. “Perfect for climbing in.”
        </p><p class="story"> 
            They continued their way up. Around halfway up the mountain, the weather started to turn sour.
        </p><p class="story">
            “Should we lower down the mountain?” David was getting worried. “The weather is starting to get bad.”
        </p><p class="story">
            “It should be fine.” Henry reassured. “It’s only a little rain and wind.”
        </p><p class="story">
            But around three quarters of the way up, the weather became stronger. The two were drenched in rain, and were being tossed around in their ropes.
        </p><p class="story">
            “We better go down the mountain now.” David urged.
        </p><p class="story">
            “I think that would be a good idea.” Henry agreed. “It is almost impossible to continue climbing now.”
        </p><p class="story">
            As they started lowering themselves, the air became foggy and cold. It became impossible to see more than a few feet down. Their rock climbing gear became icy and frozen making them hard to use. The howling wind blew them around like a rodeo. Then David’s rope snapped. He started to fall and scream. Thankfully, he caught onto a branch.
        </p><p class="story">
            “Help me!” David shouted. “I’m losing my grip!”
        </p><p class="story">
            Henry started lowering toward David. But Henry ran out of rope, and started falling. He grabbed onto a nearby branch. The two of them were now next to each other, separated by a few feet.
        </p><p class="story">
            “I am not tied into the rope anymore!” Henry yelled.
        </p><p class="story">
            “What do we do? If we fall off we will probably die.”
        </p><p class="story">
            Henry kicked the rock with his foot, and felt a ledge to stand. He pulled himself to the ledge. “David! There’s a ledge over here! We can stand on it until the weather clears up.”
        </p><p class="story">
            “How will I get over there? I can barely see anything.”
        </p><p class="story">
            “Place your feet on the wall and try to climb toward me. Once you get closer, I’ll pull you in.”
        </p><p class="story">
            “Pull me?” David questioned. “You can barely hold yourself. How will you pull me?”
        </p><p class="story">
            “Just trust me,” Henry reassured. “Besides, you’ll fall if you just stay there.”
        </p><p class="story">
            David slowly pulled himself to the wall. The wind kept pushing against him, trying to blow him off. As he climbed toward the ledge, his foot slipped, and he almost fell.
        </p><p class="story">
            “Don’t rush!” Henry cautioned. “Go slowly!”
        </p><p class="story">
            David didn’t talk, focusing on stepping in the right places.
        </p><p class="story">
            “I can reach you now! I’m going to grab your arm” Henry reached out.
        </p><p class="story">
            “Pull me in now!” David shouted.
        </p><p class="story">
            Henry tried to pull him in, while trying not to fall off at the same time. David eventually crashed into the mountain face, and the both sat on the ledge. They were both exhausted but relieved. The two of them dozed off while waiting for the weather to clear.
        </p><p class="story">
            After around an hour, the fog cleared, and the rain and wind died down. A splendid rainbow formed in the sky. Henry and David woke up and looked down. They were only five feet above the ground.

        <h2>Prison - 11/14/2019</h2>
        <p>
            One night in my prison cell, I felt a little ill.<br>
            It felt dark, depressing, daunting, maybe even dead.<br>
            It felt like time was frozen, time was still.<br>
            And the night would not move ahead.<br>
            <br>
            I tried to find ways to pass the night.<br>
            I tried to tally the bugs,<br>
            But the bugs brought no delight.<br>
            And the night did not even budge.<br>
            <br>
            I looked for other things to look at.<br>
            Maybe the moon or the grass,<br>
            Or a drawing of a bat.<br>
            But the night did not pass.<br>
            <br>
            I laid down on my sheets,<br>
            My mind was in distress.<br>
            I closed my eyes, trying to make my mind at peace.<br>
            But the night did not progress.<br>
        </p>
