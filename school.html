        <p>Hello again. Here is a collection of things that are part of school. Below you can find different stories I wrote for english class, my favorite tools for school, and more.</p>

        <p>Just so you know writing is not my best subject. The date is when I submited the story to my teacher.</p>
        <h3>The School Robbery - 3/13/2020</h3>
        <p class="story">
            It was the last day of Summer. Richard and I were sad that school would start tomorrow, even though that summer was somewhat boring. Then Richard came up with a brilliant plan.
        </p><p class="story">
            “We should go to the school at night and steal school supplies.” Richard Said. “That way, school wouldn’t be able to start.”
        </p><p class="story">
            I agreed with him. In the evening, we prepared to leave. I whittled a stick to create a thin rod for picking locks. Richard tied the opening in a shirt to make a bag. After we ate dinner, we headed out toward the school. Unfortunately, some of our neighbors were currently doing their nightly vigil, some of which had a clear view of the school. After figuring out that we would definitely get caught going, we went back inside our homes. I went to bed. Around an hour later, I heard whispering.
            “Come on. There’s no one awake right now. Let’s go”
        </p><p class="story">
            I got up and went outside. We walked on eggs as we approached the school. At the door of the school, we looked around, then attempted to pick the lock. As fitted with the lock, I accidentally cleaved the stick, rendering it useless. We walked around the school and found an open window. We climbed inside, and found many gnats swarming around inside. I opened the windows to let them fly out. Richard yielded several chalkboards and chalk from draws. I wanted to get the globe from the top shelf. I climbed on top of a desk and reached up. I wasn’t tall enough. I placed some books on the desk to reach higher. As I tip-toed, the desk tipped over and I fell towards a window, shattering it. My breeches and shirt protected me from most of the glass, but my lower leg had a bunch of cuts in it. Then Richard spotted lights outside. Neighbors were waking up to see what had happened. We ran out to the nearest tree. I washed my wounds while Richard watched for Neighbors. After waiting around half an hour, we were baffled. Why didn’t anyone show up? We decided to head back to the school. We bagged up as many items as we could get then head back as fast as possible. Carrying all of the items out was burdensome, but we felt it was worth it. But then we faced a problem. Where are we going to hide these items? We figured we wouldn’t need them for anything, so we threw everything in the pond. We both ran back to our homes and went to bed.
        </p><p class="story">
            The next day, I went to school. Richard and I were waiting to be told that school was canceled, but school went on like normal. But because we hid all of the school supplies, school was less engaging. It was just a lot of talking the whole day.

        <h3>Prison - 11/14/2019</h3>
        <p>
            One night in my prison cell, I felt a little ill.<br>
            It felt dark, depressing, daunting, maybe even dead.<br>
            It felt like time was frozen, time was still.<br>
            And the night would not move ahead.<br>
            <br>
            I tried to find ways to pass the night.<br>
            I tried to tally the bugs,<br>
            But the bugs brought no delight.<br>
            And the night did not even budge.<br>
            <br>
            I looked for other things to look at.<br>
            Maybe the moon or the grass,<br>
            Or a drawing of a bat.<br>
            But the night did not pass.<br>
            <br>
            I laid down on my sheets,<br>
            My mind was in distress.<br>
            I closed my eyes, trying to make my mind at peace.<br>
            But the night did not progress.<br>
        </p>
